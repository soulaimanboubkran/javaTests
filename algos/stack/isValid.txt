How It Works
Initialization:

A generic Stack<Character> is initialized to keep track of opening brackets.
Iterate Through the String:

The method iterates over each character in the input string s.
Push Opening Brackets:

If the character is an opening bracket ((, {, [), it is pushed onto the stack.
Check Closing Brackets:

If the character is a closing bracket (), }, ]):
Check if the stack is empty. If it is, the string is invalid because there’s no corresponding opening bracket.
Otherwise, compare the top of the stack (the last pushed opening bracket) with the current closing bracket:
If the pair matches (e.g., ()), pop the stack.
If it doesn’t match, return false.
Final Check:

After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the string is valid (all opening brackets had matching closing brackets).
If not, return false.
