The three tree traversal techniques you provided differ in the order they visit the nodes of a binary tree:

---

### **1. Pre-order Traversal (Root → Left → Right)**
In pre-order traversal, the sequence is:
1. Visit the **root node** first.
2. Recursively traverse the **left subtree**.
3. Recursively traverse the **right subtree**.

For your example:
- **Pre-order Traversal**: `1 2 4 5 3 6 7`

---

### **2. In-order Traversal (Left → Root → Right)**
In in-order traversal, the sequence is:
1. Recursively traverse the **left subtree**.
2. Visit the **root node**.
3. Recursively traverse the **right subtree**.

For your example:
- **In-order Traversal**: `4 2 5 1 6 3 7`

---

### **3. Post-order Traversal (Left → Right → Root)**
In post-order traversal, the sequence is:
1. Recursively traverse the **left subtree**.
2. Recursively traverse the **right subtree**.
3. Visit the **root node** last.

For your example:
- **Post-order Traversal**: `4 5 2 6 7 3 1`

---

### Differences in Sequence
- **Pre-order** starts with the root and processes each node before its subtrees.
- **In-order** processes the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree. This traversal gives a sorted sequence for binary search trees (BSTs).
- **Post-order** processes all subtrees before visiting the root, making it useful for operations where subtrees need to be processed before the root (e.g., tree deletion).

### Visual Representation of the Tree
The sequences suggest the following binary tree:

```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
```

**Traversals from this tree**:
- **Pre-order**: Visit root (`1`), left subtree (`2, 4, 5`), then right subtree (`3, 6, 7`).
- **In-order**: Leftmost subtree (`4, 2, 5`), root (`1`), then right subtree (`6, 3, 7`).
- **Post-order**: Left subtree (`4, 5, 2`), right subtree (`6, 7, 3`), then root (`1`).
